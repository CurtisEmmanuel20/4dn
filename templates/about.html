  <p style="font-size:1.08rem; color:#fff; max-width:800px;">

  </p>
  <ul style="font-size:1.08rem; color:#fff; max-width:800px;">

    <li><strong>Elite Matchup Grading:</strong> Evaluating positional strength vs defensive schemes (e.g., WR1 vs CB1, TE vs zone coverage, slot vs man).</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Adjustments:</strong> Accounting for weather volatility, last-minute inactives, snap counts, and offensive line shifts.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Efficiency Metrics:</strong> Including Yards After Contact, Explosive Play Rate, Air Yards Conversion %, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Defensive Health Scores:</strong> A metric that captures how injured or compromised a defense is — even when big names aren’t missing.</li>
