    This DFS lineup was selected for upside and consistency based on matchup analysis, recent trends, and projected usage.
    QB {qb['name']} is playing against one of the weakest pass defenses in the league and is projected to throw multiple TDs.
    RBs {rb1['name']} and {rb2['name']} both get goal-line work and are heavily involved in the passing game.
    WR trio {wr1['name']}, {wr2['name']}, and {wr3['name']} dominate target share and face beatable secondaries.
    TE {te['name']} has the best red zone matchup this week, and DST {dst['name']} has the highest sack projection.
    Flex player was selected by ceiling potential and projected touches based on last 3 games.
